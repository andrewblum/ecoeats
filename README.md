# ecoeats

EcoEats allows you to enter food and its expiration date and then visually track that food up to that date with color indicators as it nears expiration. More importantly, it provides custom guidance for each food to see if it is *actually* expired -- most food is good far past its listed expiration date and is needlessly thrown away. Further, it provides uses for genuinely expired food -- like using rotten ketchup to polish metals. Lastly, you can get tips on how to keep specific foods fresh longer.
